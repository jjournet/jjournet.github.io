My earliest computer experience date back to 1984 with the [Thomson M05](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_MO5), french competitor to the Commodore 64, running the Microsoft BASIC interpreter.
I was lucky to have one at home, and it was also used in class.

I coded a bunch of things, hacked a few things, and ended up in a Computer Science Engineering school in France, which led me a double Master, one from the engineering school, and one from the University of Manchester, UK, with a main specialization in C/C++ development in Unix/Linux.

I started working as a software developer, even doing some TPF developement, and continued doing Linux backend development. After a few years, I started to evolved into ```development support```, the ancestor to DevOps, and evolve into DevOps and CI/CD expertise, implementing also the first hosting as a service, an in-house PaaS. A colleague dragged me into Kubernetes and Cloud, and that's where I spend my time for a few years now, between Platform engineering and CI/CD, mostly for Kubernets in a cloud-ready environement.
